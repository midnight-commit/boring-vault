# Boring Vault Deployments

**Note:** This is a minimalistic fork of Se7enSeas' Boring Vault. The structure remains the same, and we have built upon them for customized deployments.

To deploy the main components of the Boring Vault, please refer to [`spec/Sepolia.md`](spec/Sepolia.md).

To create a micro-manager, refer to [`spec/UManager.md`](spec/UManager.md).

To understand and deploy the AtomicQueue withdrawal system, which replaces the DelayedWithdrawal, please refer to [`spec/Withdrawals.md`](spec/Withdrawals.md).

# Boring Vault Architecture

For a general overview, you can refer to the original Boring Vault [repository](https://github.com/Se7en-Seas/boring-vault) or [documentation](https://docs.veda.tech) for more in-depth information.
